        The Amazon rainforest, also called Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the
        Amazon
        biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq
        mi),
        of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging
        to nine
        nations and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories.

        The majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor
        amounts in
        Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of
        one of
        their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for French Guiana's
        protected
        rainforest area. The Amazon represents over half of Earth's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and
        most
        biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about
        16,000
        species.

        planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with a dazzling
        system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets.

        It is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Like fellow gas
        giant
        Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.

        The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times.
        The
        planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter.

        ancient Greek civilization, The period between the end of the Mycenaean civilization (1200 BCE) and the death of
        Alexander the Great (323 BCE) that significantly influenced later Western culture in politics, philosophy, and
        art.

        Little is known about the earliest period of ancient Greek civilization, and many extant writings pertain only
        to life
        in Athens. Ancient Greece at its height comprised settlements in Asia Minor, southern Italy, Sicily, and the
        Greek
        islands. It was divided into city-states—Athens and Sparta were among the most powerful—that functioned
        independently of
        one another. There were frequent wars between Athens, Sparta, and their allies, including the Peloponnesian War
        (431-404
        BCE) and later the Corinthian War (395-386 BCE).

        Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is actually two separate theories: his special theory of relativity ,
        postulated
        in the 1905 paper, The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies and his theory of general relativity , an expansion of
        the
        earlier theory, published as The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity in 1916. Einstein sought to
        explain
        situations in which Newtonian physics might fail to deal successfully with phenomena, and in so doing proposed
        revolutionary changes in human concepts of time, space and gravity.
